## Description:
A project built with starter code for a e-commerce website back-end, using sequelize, node, and express.

## What I Learned:
I learned sequelize, which I really enjoyed, working with more complex, and complicated routes with the models took a minute to understand but I got used to it and then after playing around with it I feel like I understand more of how everything works together.
I followed the video step by step and took screenshots, so I think that I got everything displaying as it should be.  

## Usage
Git clone the repo
Run npm install to install dependencies
Insert your own either .env file, or replace the process.env with your own information in the config - connection.js file, and run node server in the terminal. Then in insomnia run http://localserver:3001/api/routeOfYourChoice and play around with the get, put, delete, and post options.
